# Rust OpenAPI Example

I use *FastAPI* in Python and think it is cool.
For Rust I wanted something similar.

This program is an example of a rocket http server that
uses rocket_okapi openapi crate to provide a *FastAPI* like
implemntation in Rust.

This also shows how to store State information that
persists and is thread safe.
